# Overview

Rapid Star is a PNP (Pick and Place) system developed and maintained by [Deltaprintr](https://deltaprintr.com), run on the free [OpenPNP Software](https://openpnp.org) and [Mark's Smoothieware Firmware Version](https://makr.zone/smoothieware-new-firmware-for-pnp/500/) used for assembling circuit boards with the [Rapid Feeder](https://www.deltaprintr.com/product/rapid-feeder/) system. It features a conveyor belt that can hold boards up to 165mm (6.5") wide, 50 (8mm) feeders and has a head capable of supporting up to 8 nozzles with a 20 nozzle magazine auto-changer. Documentation on building a Rapid Star can be found [on our website](https://www.deltaprintr.com/docs/rapid-star/). The release is considered stable as the machine has been fully tested manually. If you would like to show your support for the project, consider purchasing components directly from Deltaprintr. This not only allows us to continue developing the Rapid Star, but also enables us to provide support directly to you in the process.

# Benefits of a star design
- Scalable nozzle count at no additional cost
- Higher CPH
- Simpler mechanical assembly
- More X/Y space due to smaller head

# Contribute

Currently the Rapid Star is not fully supported in OpenPNP due to a few missing mandatory features. We're actively looking for developers who would be interested in helping us incorporate support into OpenPNP. You can see the [full list of features here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N6ggEopUlor0r7kC39QZDpr8pi3T8QCvNgg1l5aPtP0/edit?usp=sharing).

# Support

While you are free to source and build a Rapid Star on your own, we are only able to provide support for customers who purchase components directly from us. This way we can guarantee your parts came from a reputable source and have a warranty. It's worth noting that some custom parts such as the head must be machined to a high tolerance to ensure air does not leak. For this reason, we recommend to get parts directly from us as it will save you time and frustration. However, if you do decide to source parts elsewhere, we do have a community of users who would be happy to help you on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/t2FcjAU7hC).
