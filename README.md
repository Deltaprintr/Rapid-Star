# Overview

Rapid Star is a PNP (Pick and Place) system developed and maintained by [Deltaprintr](https://deltaprintr.com) and run on the free [OpenPNP Software](https://openpnp.org). Documentation on building a Rapid Star can be found [here on our website](https://www.deltaprintr.com/docs/rapid-star/). If you would like to show your support for the project, consider purchasing components directly from Deltaprintr. This not only allows us to continue developing the Rapid Star, but also enables us to provide support to you in the process.

# Support

While you are free to source and build a Rapid Star on your own, we are only able to provide support for customers who purchase components directly from us. This way we can guarantee your parts came from a reputable source and have a warranty. However, we do have a community of users who would be happy to help you on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/t2FcjAU7hC).
